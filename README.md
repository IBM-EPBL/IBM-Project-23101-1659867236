INTRODUCTION
The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19 
as pandemic across the world. With its alarming surge of affected cases throughout the world, 
lockdown and awareness (social distancing, use of masks etc) among people are found to be the 
only means for restricting the community transmission. In a densely populated country like India, 
it is very difficult to prevent the community transmission even during lockdown without social 
awareness and precautionary measures taken by the people. Recently, several containment zones 
had been identified throughout the country and divided into red, orange and green zones, 
respectively. The red zones indicate the infection hotspots, orange zones denote some infection 
and green zones indicate an area with no infection.




Containment Zone Alerting Application


Category: Cloud App Development 


Skills Required:

IBM Cloud,HTML,Javascript,IBM Cloud Object Storage,Python-Flask,Kubernetes,Docker,IBM DB2,IBM Container Registry


Project Idea: 

This application is intended to provide information about containment zones in a particular region by alerting people, through continuous monitoring of an individual's location. Key benefits of the application are monitoring people's activity and alerting them of their safety movements.


Features of the Application

 Admin App (portal):
 
They should login to the app and update the containment zones locations in the portal. Based on the location a Geofence will be created within a 100 meters radius. They should be able to see how many people are visiting that zone.

 User App (Mobile App):
 
The app should have a user registration and login. After the user logged into the app it will track the user's location and update the database with the current location. If the user is visiting the containment zone he will get an alert notification.
